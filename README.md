🚀 First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Implementation
Welcome to my project on CPU Scheduling Algorithms! This repository currently includes an implementation of the FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) algorithm – one of the simplest scheduling techniques in operating systems. More algorithms will be added soon! 🌟

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm where the process that arrives first gets executed first.
It's non-preemptive and follows a FIFO (First In, First Out) strategy.

✅ Easy to implement
⚠️ May lead to long waiting times for some processes (convoy effect)
